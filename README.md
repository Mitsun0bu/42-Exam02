# 42_exam_02_training  

This repository contains my solutions for the 42 School exam_02.  
At the time I passed it, it was required to do :   
- union or inter  
- ft_printf or get_next_line

Union and inter are still part of exam_02, but it now features exercises from C Piscine (no more ft_printf or get_next_line).  
Here are my solutions to these two problems.
Feel free to have a look at it but please practice before the exam in order to learn how the logic works :)
