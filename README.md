# 42_exam_02_training  

This repository contains my solutions for the 42 School exam_02.  
At the time I passed it, it was required to do :   
- union or inter.  
- ft_printf or get_next_line.

Union and inter are still present in exam_02, but it also features exercises from C Piscine.  
Here are my solutions to these two problems.
Feel free to have a look at it but please practice before the exam in order to learn how the logic works :).
